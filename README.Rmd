`covalencer` contains various R functions in use at Covalence Research for health economic modeling, literature synthesis, medical communication, or just plain old data wrangling. Perhaps most notably, it provides access to the Covalence ggplot theme and associated color palettes.

## How to install

You can install the development version of `covalencer` from [GitHub](https://github.com/CovalenceResearch/covalencer) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("CovalenceResearch/covalencer")
```

## How to use

Please note that the package is very much a work in progress, with things likely to break (deliberately and not so deliberately). Use the package at your own risk.

### ggplot theme

Apply `theme_covalence()` to an existing `ggplot` object, like any other theme:

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(covalencer)

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = color), alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_colour_covalence_d(palette = "complete") +
    facet_wrap(vars(cut)) +
    theme_covalence()
```
